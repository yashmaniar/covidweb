                  To achieve these outcomes, Member States must mobilize a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach that highlights each person’s role in supporting one another to stay safe, healthy and well. Regular hand-washing, coughing or sneezing into one’s elbow, and avoiding contact with people with flu-like symptoms are crucial to staying healthy. So too is following local and national guidance on physical distancing. Avoid using tobacco, alcohol and other substances that impair the immune system and damage health. Support health workers and say no to stigma.

We must also stay well. Look after your mental health and be supportive of others.
We must continue to stand together to tackle what is the greatest public health challenge of a generation. The Region’s strategy to control and suppress spread, strengthen and maintain health services, and support each other to stay safe, healthy and well, will help all countries to save lives and minimize impact. Our mission is clear. Our challenge is great. Together, forward in the fight against COVID-19.

                  As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the awareness and preparedness of the targeted community members, especially the less educated ones. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach the targeted residents beyond borders and further measures are warranted. The outcome of this study highlighted a growing need for the adoption of innovative local strategies to improve awareness in general population related to COVID-19 and its preventative practices in order to meet its elimination goals.

                  To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: 
                  <br><br>

Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you.
Stay at least 1 metre apart from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.
Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings.
Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
If you feel unwell, stay home and self-isolate until you recover.

          <h2>Coronavirus what it is?</h2>
          <p>
            COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is a viral respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus first emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has since spread globally, leading to a pandemic that has affected millions of people.

The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets that are generated when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, although some people may experience more mild or severe symptoms.

COVID-19 can be particularly dangerous for older adults and people with underlying health conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. However, it can also affect people of all ages and health statuses, and some people may experience long-term complications even after recovering from the initial illness.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, public health officials have recommended measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, washing hands frequently, and getting vaccinated. Vaccines have been developed and are being distributed globally to help prevent COVID-19, although there is still ongoing research to determine their long-term effectiveness against emerging variants of the virus.

The pandemic has had a significant impact on economies, healthcare systems, and daily life for people around the world, and efforts are ongoing to mitigate the spread of the virus and its effects on society.

            <h5>Wear Mask</h5>
            <p>
              Wear a face mask in indoor public spaces if you're in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital and new COVID-19 cases, whether or not you're vaccinated. The CDC recommends wearing the most protective mask possible that you'll wear regularly, fits well and is comfortable.

              Stay home and limit your contact with others when you're sick or experiencing any COVID-like symptoms, even if mild. This will help prevent others in your community from getting sick.
Isolation is used to prevent the spread from people who are sick (with or without symptoms) to others.
